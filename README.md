# Calculator

A simple calculator application base used for the Fenway Group Scrum training course.

## Purpose

You will be working with your team to build a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout this project, you'll take part in various Agile events that will help you learn more about Scrum and how we use it here at Fenway Group.

## Setup

Please work to have these steps completed before the first class session. If you have any issues, feel free to reach out to a team lead or bring your questions to class.

You will need to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). This is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that we will be using for this project.

Once you have VS Code installed, you'll need to clone this project to your local computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karey-higuera/agile-calculator.git
```

Once the project is cloned to your local computer, move into that directory and open the project in VS Code.

```bash
cd agile-calculator && code .
```

### IDE Setup

Upon opening the project in VS Code, you will receive a notification to install the recommended extensions. Accept the notification and install the extensions, as these will greatly assist you in the coding part of this project.

## Development
